 * USPS charges 49c to mail a standard, rectangular letter.

 USPS charges an extra 21c to mail a non-machinable letter,
 the type of letter that can't be processed by their mail-sorting machines.

 Rectangular letters can be processed by machine. Square, circular or other shaped letters can't be processed by machine.
 Letters must be flat to be processed by machine. Letters that are not flat (with bumps or have a curved shape) can't be processed by machine.

 Write a letter mailing price calculating program.

 Ask the user what shape their letter is - rectangular or not
 Ask the user if their letter is flat or not

 Calculate and display the cost to mail the letter.
